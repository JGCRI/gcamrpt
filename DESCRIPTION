Title: Convert GCAM results to the format required by various IAM experiment databases
Version: 0.3.0
Authors@R: c(
    person("Robert", "Link", email = "robert.link@pnnl.gov", role = c("aut", "cre")),

    )
Description: Provide functions for converting GCAM output into the format used by most 
    IAM experiments to enter results into their databases.  Users provide a table of
    desired outputs, along with options (such as filtering and aggregation), and the 
    package runs the necessary GCAM queries (no more than once per query) and passes
    the results to the functions that produce the output.
